Thin Ada binding to SDL2 v209

This is a thin Ada binding to the popular C library SDL2 version 2.0.9.

To use the binding you will need a recent Ada compiler.

Note that this binding does NOT include

* SDL2-image,

* SDL2-ttf,

* SDL2-mixer.

but was used in my games "AdaGate" and "AdaVenture".

5dec2019 update:  Due to difficulties trying to prepare SDL2 v2.0.10, I decided to add files to complete this repository, including the include files and library files for v2.0.9 for 3 platforms.




# Details:

**autogenerated with "acgen.sh" using AdaCore2019 with a few changes made by hand:**

* replaced unsigned with cint (interfaces.c.int)
	in several places to minimize my game code changes;
	e.g. sdl_video_h.ads:  profile/context flags.
* changed type of hint constants for ease of use;
	see sdl_hints_h.ads
* renamed sdl_scancode_h.ads to sdl_scancode_inc.ads
	due to name clash;
* removed several .ads files that seemed unused.
* added keycode constants to sdl_keycode_h.ads.
* modified button constants in sdl_mouse_h.ads
