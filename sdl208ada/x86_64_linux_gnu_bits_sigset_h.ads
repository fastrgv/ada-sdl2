  -- We only want to define these functions if <signal.h> was actually
  --   included; otherwise we were included just to define the types.  Since we
  --   are namespace-clean, it wouldn't hurt to define extra macros.  But
  --   trouble can be caused by functions being defined (e.g., any global
  --   register vars declared later will cause compilation errors).   

  -- Return a mask that includes the bit for SIG only.   
  -- Return the word index for SIG.   
  -- The POSIX does not specify for handling the whole signal set in one
  --   command.  This is often wanted and so we define three more functions
  --   here.   

  -- These functions needn't check for a bogus signal number -- error
  --   checking is done in the non __ versions.
