  -- The x86-64 architecture computes values with the precission of the
  --   used type.  Similarly for -m32 -mfpmath=sse.   

  -- `float' expressions are evaluated as `float'.   
   subtype float_t is float;  -- /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/bits/mathdef.h:28

  -- `double' expressions are evaluated
  --				   as `double'.   

   subtype double_t is double;  -- /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/bits/mathdef.h:29

  -- The ix87 FPUs evaluate all values in the 80 bit floating-point format
  --   which is also available for the user as `long double'.  Therefore we
  --   define:   

  -- `float' expressions are evaluated as
  --				   `long double'.   

  -- `double' expressions are evaluated as
  --				   `long double'.   

  -- The values returned by `ilogb' for 0 and NaN respectively.   
  -- The GCC 4.6 compiler will define __FP_FAST_FMA{,F,L} if the fma{,f,l}
  --   builtins are supported.
