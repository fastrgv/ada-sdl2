=============================================================
autogenerated using "acgen.sh" with a few
changes made by hand:

1) deconflicted C++ variables or type names that were 
	distinguished only by CASE;
2) deconflicted name "FILE" [ reserved word in Ada ]
3) moved some popular declarations into sdl.ads
4) minimally editted specs:
	a) sdl_rwops_h.ads
	b) libio_h.ads
	c) sdl_events_h.ads
5) the contents of sdl_h.ads was moved into sdl.ads
6) stdio_h.ads was omitted, as well as several other
	generated specs that seemed unused.  Thus, the
	resulting binding may be incomplete...yet, more
	complete than my previous binding to SDL2.  Moreover,
	I heard that they typically try to make new
	versions of SDL2 backward compatible.  So this
	binding may be adequate indefinitely.
7) types defined in x86_64_linux* were replaced by
	more generic Ada types or by types from interfaces.c.
